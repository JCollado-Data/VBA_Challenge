## **Project Overview**
The Purpose of this project was to analize sotck market data from 2017 adnd 2018. We evaulated both years looking at the stock price at the beginning of the year til the end of the year. We also evaluated the stock volume to compare overtime.

## **Results**
### 2017 Results
The overall results for the selected stocsk in 2017 was positive. Of the 12 stocks presented, 11 showed positive results ranging anywhere from 5.5% to 199.4% rise in price. The only stock to have a negative result was "TERP" with saw a -7.2% drop in stock price during 2017. The best performing stock was "DQ" with 199.4% rise in price.

### 2018 Results
2018 showed a massive turn in the market for the selected stocks. Of the 12 stocks, 2 showed positive results "ENPH" 81.9% and "RUN" 84.0%. The negative performing stock saw a drop in price ranging from -3.5% to -62.6%. 

### Comparision 
When looking at the data over the two year 2017 and 2018 we can see how the stocks performed overtime. We can see that over the past two years only two stocks have had positive returns, "ENPH" and "RUN". "ENPH" has performed the best over the two years examined with an overall return of 211.4%. The worst performing stock over two years was "SPWR" which saw a return decline of -21.5%. The code run time for 2017 was 0.078 seconds and 2018 ran in 0.070 seconds.

### Summary
In summary the advantages of refactoring code is the simple facts that it can save time. If you are asking 3 or 4 questions that are similar but require different variables could be completed with a refactored code. At the same time a possible disadvantage could be the refactored code itself. You might run into error and might not realize you forgot to change one thing. This could be avoided by thinking out the code and writing out fresh.
